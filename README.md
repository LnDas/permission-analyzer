# Permission Analyzer

## Why I Built This

As a developer advocating for user privacy and digital transparency, I created **Permission Analyzer**, a lightweight **Chrome permission logger**, to provide a transparent view of browser permissions in real time. In an age where **camera, mic, or location access** often happens silently, this browser privacy tool helps users stay informed about what websites are requesting ‚Äî without compromising their privacy.

Built with simplicity, performance, and security in mind, this extension reflects my ongoing commitment to **open-source tools** that prioritize user trust and control.

## Privacy & Security

This extension prioritizes privacy:

- No external requests  
- No analytics  
- No tracking  
- All data stays in your browser (via `chrome.storage.local`)  
- The source code is 100% open source and auditable  
- You're in full control

## üì¶ About the Extension

**Permission Analyzer** is a privacy-focused **browser extension** that logs when websites access sensitive browser permissions like:

- Location  
- Microphone  
- Camera  
- Clipboard Read  
- Notifications  

Each permission access is logged with a timestamp and stored only on your device.  
You can easily export your logs as a **Markdown file** for records, audits, or reporting.

It‚Äôs an ideal tool to **track camera and mic access in Chrome**, and monitor how often sites interact with sensitive browser capabilities.

## üí° What Makes It Different

Unlike traditional permission managers or privacy blockers, **Permission Analyzer** is designed to give you visibility ‚Äî not just control. Here's how it's different:

- **Logs real-time permission access events** like camera, mic, location, etc.  
- **Timestamped history** lets you track when a website accessed sensitive permissions  
-  **Works entirely offline** ‚Äî no cloud, no data sync, no external requests  
-  **Markdown export** for easy documentation, reporting, or analysis  
-  Built with **vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äî no frameworks or trackers  
-  Open-source, lightweight, and transparent ‚Äî fully auditable on GitHub

Most other tools block or manage permissions, but few (if any) give you a complete log of how and when your browser permissions are used.  
**Permission Analyzer fills that gap** ‚Äî making it a unique browser privacy tool.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- When a website requests a permission, the extension checks its status using Chrome‚Äôs **Permissions API**.
- If access is **granted** or **denied** (not just prompted), it logs the permission name and timestamp.
- Logs are shown in a simple popup UI.
- You can export logs to Markdown with one click.

This extension is especially useful to **log site permission usage** over time, something most extensions don‚Äôt offer.
